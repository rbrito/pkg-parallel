parallel (20130622-1) unstable; urgency=low

  With this release, we make the GNU parallel package have its native
  behavior by default, that is, the one provided by the `--gnu` command
  line option.

  This is accomplished by removing the conffile /etc/parallel/config if
  you have not changed it. Previously, the file contained the sole option
  `--tollef`, for compatibility with the moreutils package.

  If you made changes to the file, they will be preserved, but be warned
  that keeping the `--tollef` option is not a recommended mode of
  execution of GNU parallel.
