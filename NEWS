* A tutorial showing much of GNU Parallel's functionality. Spend an
  hour walking through the tutorial. Your commandline will love you
  for it. man parallel_tutorial

* --line-buffer will buffer output on line basis. --group keeps the
  output together for a whole job. --ungroup allows output to mixup
  with half a line coming from one job and half a line coming from
  another job. --line-buffer fits between these two; it prints a full
  line, but will allow for mixing lines of different jobs.

* --record-env records all variables and functions set. Useful to
  record the normal environment before using --env _.

* --env _ exports all functions and variables to the remote server
  except for the ones recorded.

* New signing key. Due to recommendations from NIST
  http://www.keylength.com/en/4/ the signing key was changed from

* '-L n --pipe' will use records of n lines. This is useful when
  processing data that have fixed records with a fixed number of
  lines (e.g. fastq).

* --filter-hosts will remove down hosts. For each remote host: check
  that login through ssh works. If not: do not use this host.
  Currently you can not put --filter-hosts in a profile, $PARALLEL,
  /etc/parallel/config or similar. This is because GNU Parallel uses
  GNU Parallel to compute this, so you will get an infinite loop. This
  will likely be fixed in a later release.

* --pipe now uses fork() instead of busy wait. The performance should
  be better on computers with >10 cores while remaining the same on
  computers with few cores.

* GNU Parallel will be represented at Chiang Mai Bar Camp.

* niceload: --run-io will slow down a program if disk io goes above a
  certain limit.

* niceload: --run-load will slow down a program if loadaverage goes
  above a certain limit.

* niceload: --run-mem will slow down a program if free memory goes
  below a certain limit.

* niceload: --run-noswap will slow down a program if the computer is
  swapping.

* niceload: --start-io, --start-load, --start-mem, --start-noswap will
  defer starting a program until the system is below the limit.

* --io, --load, --mem, and --noswap sets both --run-* and --start-*.

* niceload got a major rewrite and is now object oriented.

* --onall will run all the jobs on all the computers. This is useful
  for systemadinistrators having multiple servers.

* --nonall runs like --onall but reads no arguments from stdin
  (standard input), so is possible to do:
  parallel --nonall -S computer1,computer2 uptime

* Context replace now works with multiple input sources:
  parallel -X echo {1}-{2} ::: 1 2 3 ::: a b c

* --noswap do not start a job on a server that is swapping.

* Multiple ::: can be put on the command line and will be treated
  similar to contents from multiple -a's.

* ::: and :::: can now be mixed on the command line. Use {1} .. {n} to
  refer to inputs from the different input sources.

* --xapply is now needed to get xapply's behaviour of reading one line
  from each of the input sources.

* Multiple input sources will cause all combinations of arguments from
  the sources to be generated. E.g. 'parallel echo {1}+{2} ::: 1 2 :::
  a b c' will print 1+a 1+b 1+c 2+a 2+b 2+c. This can often replace
  nested loops.

* Implemented {//} for the input line with the basename removed (dirname).

* New video showing the new ::: and :::: input sources.

* --tollef to be switch compatible with Tollef's parallel. This will
  cause -l to mean --load, and the argument separator will be --
  instead of :::

* --gnu will force GNU Parallel to behave like GNU Parallel even if
  --tollef is set.

* Site wide config file: /etc/parallel/config

  This should solve the issue with some packagers renaming GNU
  Parallel to gparallel to avoid the naming conflict.

  By putting --tollef in the site wide config file you can deinstall
  Tollef's parallel and install GNU Parallel instead without any
  change for users or scripts. This is useful for packagers that
  currently rename GNU Parallel or simply do not distribute GNU
  Parallel because the command name conflicts with Tollef's parallel.

* -L 0 -n 0, and -N 0 implemented. They will read one argument,
  but insert 0 arguments on the command line. Useful if you just want
  to run the same command with the same arguments a number of times.

* --pipe splits piped data into blocks. Each block is piped to a
  program for processing. The piping and the programs will be run in
  parallel. Useful if the data you want to process is data for a
  program and not arguments.

* --blocksize sets the blocksize in bytes for --pipe. The blocksize is
  approximate. It can deviate as much as the size of one record.
  Default is 1M.

* --recstart sets the string matching the start of a
  record. Default is "".

* --recend sets the string matching the end of a
  record. Default is '\n'. To specify none use --recend "".

  If both --recstart and --recend are set, the end of a record must be
  followed immediately by a start of a record. This is useful if
  either recend or recstart can occur in the middle of a record.

* --remove-rec-sep removes the string matched by --recstart and
  --recend.

* --regexp will make GNU Parallel treat --recstart and --recend as
  regular expressions.

* --output-as-files will put the output of the programs into files and
  instead of giving the output GNU Parallel will output the name of
  these files.

* -N if used with --pipe sets the number of records to read.

* New video showing --pipe at

* GNU niceload is now part of GNU Parallel. GNU niceload slows down a
  program if the load average is above a certain limit.

* Implemented --tmpdir to buffer standard output and standard error in
  a different place.

* Implemented --load to wait until the load is below a limit before
  starting another job on that computer.

* Implemented --nice set the niceness of jobs running both locally and
  remotely.

* Implemented --dry-run to print the job without running it.

* Implemented --tty as the old default of assigning a tty to the first
  job causes problems.

* Review with focus on clusters. Thanks to Taylor Gillespie

* Quite a few bug fixes and man page updates.


20101202

* Implemented {/} for the input line with the path removed (basename).

* Implemented {/.} for the input line with extension and path removed
  (basename).

* Output from --progress is now sent to standard error instead of
  standard output.

* --eta was broken and counted down from 0. Now fixed.

* Standard output and standard error are flushed after every job so if
  standard output does not end with a newline it will still be grouped
  with the rest of standard output.

* --command, -c, --file, and -f are now removed as options. They were
  never used in practice.

* GetOptionsFromArray rewritten to work with old Perl libraries.

* The file COPYING now contains the GNU General Public License 3

* Major rewrite to make the code more object oriented and easier to
  maintain in the future.


20101113

* Using -j myfile the number of jobs can be changed while GNU Parallel
  is running simply by changing the content of myfile.

* Implemented --profile to use different .parallel/config for
  different situations.

* Ugly newlines in $PARALLEL and .parallel/config are no longer
  needed.  Instead you have to use \ in front of special shell
  characters.

* --workdir puts the files transferred to remote machines in a
  specified directory.

* $PARALLEL_PID is set to the process id of GNU Parallel.

* $PARALLEL_SEQ is set to the sequence number of the job.

* -v now only shows the command to run. Use -v -v to show the
   ssh/rsync wrapping.

* Slow spawning error is now only a warning.

* If stdin is a tty and input is read from stdin you now get a
  warning.

* GNU sql: \n and \x0a in arguments is replaced with newline.

* Untested Debian and xUbuntu packages available through OpenSUSE
  build service:
  https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=parallel&project=home%3Atange

* Using --retries a job will be retried on another computer if it
  fails. This is useful if some jobs fail for no apparent reason (such
  as network failure).

* BSD xargs -o (open /dev/tty) is now default for the job running in
  foreground. Useful for interactive commands like:
  ls | parallel -Xuj1 vi

* GNU sql now supports SQLite.

* Renamed .dburl.aliases to .sql/aliases and /etc/sql/aliases.

* GNU sql now support --list-tables

* Alias for DBURL can contain '?query' part with %-quoting.

* sql - a small script to access sql bases from the command line which
  is a handy companion to parallel --colsep


20100822

* Counting semaphore functionality: start a job in the background. If
  N jobs are already running, wait for one to complete. Examples:
  sem 'sleep 2; echo foo'; sem 'sleep 1; echo bar'; sem --wait
  sem -j2 'sleep 2; echo foo'; sem -j2 'sleep 1; echo bar'; sem --wait

* With --colsep a table can be used as input. Example:
  cat tab_sep_table | parallel --colsep '\t' echo col1 {1} col2 {2}

* --trim can remove white space around arguments.

* --sshloginfile '..' means use ~/.parallel/sshloginfile

* New video showing the new options.
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpaiGYxkSuQ or at
  http://tinyogg.com/watch/TORaR/ and http://tinyogg.com/watch/hfxKj/

* 100% options complete with xargs. All options for xargs can now be
  used in GNU Parallel - even the more exotic.

* --basefile for transferring basedata. When running jobs on remote
  computers --basefile will transfer files before the first jobs is
  run. It can be used to transfer data that remains the same for each
  job such as scripts or lookup tables.

* --progress shows progress. To see how many jobs is running on each
  server use --progress. It can be turned on even after GNU Parallel
  is started.

* --eta shows estimated time left in seconds.

* --halt-on-error stops if an error occurs. GNU Parallel will default
  to run all jobs - even if some of them fail. With --halt-on-error
  GNU Parallel can ignore errors, wait for the currently running jobs
  to finish, or stop immediately when an error occurs.
