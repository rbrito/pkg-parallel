.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using
one or more computers. A job can be a single command or a small
script that has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The
typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, a
list of URLs, or a list of tables. A job can also be a command that
reads from a pipe. \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR can then split the input into
blocks and pipe a block into each command in parallel.
.PP
If you use xargs and tee today you will find \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR very easy to
use as \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR is written to have the same options as xargs. If
you write loops in shell, you will find \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR may be able to
replace most of the loops and make them run faster by running several
jobs in parallel.
.PP
\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR makes sure output from the commands is the same output as
you would get had you run the commands sequentially. This makes it
possible to use output from \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR as input for other programs.
.PP
For each line of input \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR will execute \fIcommand\fR with
the line as arguments. If no \fIcommand\fR is given, the line of input is
executed. Several lines will be run in parallel. \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR can
often be used as a substitute for \fBxargs\fR or \fBcat | bash\fR.

Start by watching the intro videos for a quick introduction:
http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL284C9FF2488BC6D1
.PP
Then look at the \fB\s-1EXAMPLE\s0\fRs after the list of \fB\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR. That will
give you an idea of what \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR is capable of.
.PP
Then spend an hour walking through the tutorial (\fBman
parallel_tutorial\fR). Your command line will love you for it.
.PP
Finally you may want to look at the rest of this manual if you have
special needs not already covered.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fIcommand\fR" 9
.IX Item "command"
Command to execute.  If \fIcommand\fR or the following arguments contain
replacement strings (such as \fB{}\fR) every instance will be substituted
with the input.
.Sp
If \fIcommand\fR is given, \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR solve the same tasks as
\&\fBxargs\fR. If \fIcommand\fR is not given \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR will behave
similar to \fBcat | sh\fR.
.Sp
The \fIcommand\fR must be an executable, a script, a composed command, or
a function.
.Sp
If it is a Bash function you need to \fBexport \-f\fR the function
first. To use aliases copy the full environment as described under
\&\fB\-\-env\fR and use \fBenv_parallel\fR instead of \fBparallel\fR.
.Sp
If it is a zsh function you will need to use this helper function
\&\fBexportf\fR to export and to set \f(CW$PARALLEL_SHELL\fR to bash:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  function exportf (){
\&    export $(echo $1)="\`whence \-f $1 | sed \-e "s/$1 //" \`"
\&  }
\&
\&  function my_func(){
\&    echo $1;
\&    echo "hello";
\&  }
\&
\&  exportf my_func
\&  PARALLEL_SHELL=/bin/bash parallel "my_func {}" :::  1 2
.Ve
.Sp
The command cannot contain the character \e257 (macron: X).
.IP "\fB{}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{}"
Input line. This replacement string will be replaced by a full line
read from the input source. The input source is normally stdin
(standard input), but can also be given with \fB\-a\fR, \fB:::\fR, or
\&\fB::::\fR.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{}\fR can be changed with \fB\-I\fR.
.Sp
If the command line contains no replacement strings then \fB{}\fR will be
appended to the command line.
.IP "\fB{.}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{.}"
Input line without extension. This replacement string will be replaced
by the input with the extension removed. If the input line contains
\&\fB.\fR after the last \fB/\fR the last \fB.\fR till the end of the string will
be removed and \fB{.}\fR will be replaced with the
remaining. E.g. \fIfoo.jpg\fR becomes \fIfoo\fR, \fIsubdir/foo.jpg\fR becomes
\&\fIsubdir/foo\fR, \fIsub.dir/foo.jpg\fR becomes \fIsub.dir/foo\fR,
\&\fIsub.dir/bar\fR remains \fIsub.dir/bar\fR. If the input line does not
contain \fB.\fR it will remain unchanged.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{.}\fR can be changed with \fB\-\-er\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{/}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{/}"
Basename of input line. This replacement string will be replaced by
the input with the directory part removed.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{/}\fR can be changed with
\&\fB\-\-basenamereplace\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{//}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{//}"
Dirname of input line. This replacement string will be replaced by the
dir of the input line. See \fBdirname\fR(1).
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{//}\fR can be changed with
\&\fB\-\-dirnamereplace\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{/.}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{/.}"
Basename of input line without extension. This replacement string will
be replaced by the input with the directory and extension part
removed. It is a combination of \fB{/}\fR and \fB{.}\fR.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{/.}\fR can be changed with
\&\fB\-\-basenameextensionreplace\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{#}\fR (alpha testing)" 9
.IX Item "{#} (alpha testing)"
Sequence number of the job to run. This replacement string will be
replaced by the sequence number of the job being run. It contains the
same number as \f(CW$PARALLEL_SEQ\fR.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{#}\fR can be changed with \fB\-\-seqreplace\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{%}\fR (alpha testing)" 9
.IX Item "{%} (alpha testing)"
Job slot number. This replacement string will be replaced by the job's
slot number between 1 and number of jobs to run in parallel. There
will never be 2 jobs running at the same time with the same job slot
number.
.Sp
The replacement string \fB{%}\fR can be changed with \fB\-\-slotreplace\fR.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{n}"
Argument from input source \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument. This
positional replacement string will be replaced by the input from input
source \fIn\fR (when used with \fB\-a\fR or \fB::::\fR) or with the \fIn\fR'th
argument (when used with \fB\-N\fR). If \fIn\fR is negative it refers to the
\&\fIn\fR'th last argument.
.Sp
To understand replacement strings see \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR.\fB}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{n.}"
Argument from input source \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument without
extension. It is a combination of \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR and \fB{.}\fR.
.Sp
This positional replacement string will be replaced by the input from
input source \fIn\fR (when used with \fB\-a\fR or \fB::::\fR) or with the
\&\fIn\fR'th argument (when used with \fB\-N\fR). The input will have the
extension removed.
.Sp
To understand positional replacement strings see \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR/\fB}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{n/}"
Basename of argument from input source \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument.
It is a combination of \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR and \fB{/}\fR.
.Sp
This positional replacement string will be replaced by the input from
input source \fIn\fR (when used with \fB\-a\fR or \fB::::\fR) or with the
\&\fIn\fR'th argument (when used with \fB\-N\fR). The input will have the
directory (if any) removed.
.Sp
To understand positional replacement strings see \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR//\fB}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{n//}"
Dirname of argument from input source \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument.
It is a combination of \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR and \fB{//}\fR.
.Sp
This positional replacement string will be replaced by the dir of the
input from input source \fIn\fR (when used with \fB\-a\fR or \fB::::\fR) or with
the \fIn\fR'th argument (when used with \fB\-N\fR). See \fBdirname\fR(1).
.Sp
To understand positional replacement strings see \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR/.\fB}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{n/.}"
Basename of argument from input source \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument
without extension.  It is a combination of \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR, \fB{/}\fR, and
\&\fB{.}\fR.
.Sp
This positional replacement string will be replaced by the input from
input source \fIn\fR (when used with \fB\-a\fR or \fB::::\fR) or with the
\&\fIn\fR'th argument (when used with \fB\-N\fR). The input will have the
directory (if any) and extension removed.
.Sp
To understand positional replacement strings see \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB{=\fR\fIperl expression\fR\fB=}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{=perl expression=}"
Replace with calculated \fIperl expression\fR. \fB\f(CB$_\fB\fR will contain the
same as \fB{}\fR. After evaluating \fIperl expression\fR \fB\f(CB$_\fB\fR will be used
as the value. It is recommended to only change \f(CW$_\fR but you have full
access to all of \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR's internal functions and data
structures.
.Sp
The \fB{=\fR\fIperl expression\fR\fB=}\fR must be given as a single string.
.Sp
See also: \fB\-\-rpl\fR \fB\-\-parens\fR
.IP "\fB{=\fR\fIn\fR \fIperl expression\fR\fB=}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{=n perl expression=}"
Positional equivalent to \fB{= perl expression =}\fR. To understand
positional replacement strings see \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.Sp
See also: \fB{= perl expression =}\fR \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB:::\fR \fIarguments\fR" 9
.IX Item "::: arguments"
Use arguments from the command line as input source instead of stdin
(standard input). Unlike other options for \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR \fB:::\fR is
placed after the \fIcommand\fR and before the arguments.
.Sp
The following are equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  (echo file1; echo file2) | parallel gzip
\&  parallel gzip ::: file1 file2
\&  parallel gzip {} ::: file1 file2
\&  parallel \-\-arg\-sep ,, gzip {} ,, file1 file2
\&  parallel \-\-arg\-sep ,, gzip ,, file1 file2
\&  parallel ::: "gzip file1" "gzip file2"
.Ve
.Sp
To avoid treating \fB:::\fR as special use \fB\-\-arg\-sep\fR to set the
argument separator to something else. See also \fB\-\-arg\-sep\fR.
.Sp
stdin (standard input) will be passed to the first process run.
.Sp
If multiple \fB:::\fR are given, each group will be treated as an input
source, and all combinations of input sources will be
generated. E.g. ::: 1 2 ::: a b c will result in the combinations
(1,a) (1,b) (1,c) (2,a) (2,b) (2,c). This is useful for replacing
nested for-loops.
.Sp
\&\fB:::\fR and \fB::::\fR can be mixed. So these are equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  parallel echo {1} {2} {3} ::: 6 7 ::: 4 5 ::: 1 2 3
\&  parallel echo {1} {2} {3} :::: <(seq 6 7) <(seq 4 5) :::: <(seq 1 3)
\&  parallel \-a <(seq 6 7) echo {1} {2} {3} :::: <(seq 4 5) :::: <(seq 1 3)
\&  parallel \-a <(seq 6 7) \-a <(seq 4 5) echo {1} {2} {3} ::: 1 2 3
\&  seq 6 7 | parallel \-a \- \-a <(seq 4 5) echo {1} {2} {3} ::: 1 2 3
\&  seq 4 5 | parallel echo {1} {2} {3} :::: <(seq 6 7) \- ::: 1 2 3
.Ve
.IP "\fB::::\fR \fIargfiles\fR" 9

.Sp
\&\fB:::\fR and \fB::::\fR can be mixed.

.IP "\fB\-\-null\fR" 9
.IX Item "--null"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-0\fR" 9
.IX Item "-0"
.PD
Use \s-1NUL\s0 as delimiter.  Normally input lines will end in \en
(newline). If they end in \e0 (\s-1NUL\s0), then use this option. It is useful
for processing arguments that may contain \en (newline).
.IP "\fB\-\-arg\-file\fR \fIinput-file\fR" 9
.IX Item "--arg-file input-file"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-a\fR \fIinput-file\fR" 9
.IX Item "-a input-file"
.PD
Use \fIinput-file\fR as input source. If you use this option, stdin
(standard input) is given to the first process run.  Otherwise, stdin
(standard input) is redirected from /dev/null.
.Sp
If multiple \fB\-a\fR are given, each \fIinput-file\fR will be treated as an
input source, and all combinations of input sources will be
generated. E.g. The file \fBfoo\fR contains \fB1 2\fR, the file \fBbar\fR
contains \fBa b c\fR.  \fB\-a foo\fR \fB\-a bar\fR will result in the combinations
(1,a) (1,b) (1,c) (2,a) (2,b) (2,c). This is useful for replacing
nested for-loops.

Input items are terminated by the specified character.  Quotes and

newline-separated items, although it is almost always better to design
your program to use \-\-null where this is possible.  The specified
delimiter may be a single character, a C\-style character escape such

Count the number of physical CPUs instead of \s-1CPU\s0 cores. When computing
how many jobs to run simultaneously relative to the number of \s-1CPU\s0 cores
you can ask \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR to instead look at the number of physical
CPUs. This will make sense for computers that have hyperthreading as
two jobs running on one \s-1CPU\s0 with hyperthreading will run slower than
two jobs running on two physical CPUs. Some multi-core CPUs can run
faster if only one thread is running per physical \s-1CPU.\s0 Most users will
not need this option.

Files transferred using \fB\-\-transfer\fR and \fB\-\-return\fR will be relative

the dir \fImydir\fR.
.Sp
The special \fImydir\fR value \fB...\fR will create working dirs under
\&\fB~/.parallel/tmp/\fR on the remote computers. If \fB\-\-cleanup\fR is given
these dirs will be removed.
.Sp
The special \fImydir\fR value \fB.\fR uses the current working dir.  If the
current working dir is beneath your home dir, the value \fB.\fR is
treated as the relative path to your home dir. This means that if your
home dir is different on remote computers (e.g. if your login is
different) the relative path will still be relative to your home dir.

The simplest solution to grep a big file for a lot of regexps is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    grep \-f regexps.txt bigfile
.Ve
.PP
Or if the regexps are fixed strings:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    grep \-F \-f regexps.txt bigfile
.Ve
.PP
There are 2 limiting factors: \s-1CPU\s0 and disk I/O. \s-1CPU\s0 is easy to
measure: If the grep takes >90% \s-1CPU \s0(e.g. when running top), then the
\&\s-1CPU\s0 is a limiting factor, and parallelization will speed this up. If
not, then disk I/O is the limiting factor, and depending on the disk
system it may be faster or slower to parallelize. The only way to know
for certain is to measure.
.PP
If the \s-1CPU\s0 is the limiting factor parallelization should be done on the regexps:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    cat regexp.txt | parallel \-\-pipe \-L1000 \-\-round\-robin grep \-f \- bigfile
.Ve
.PP
If a line matches multiple regexps, the line may be duplicated. The command
will start one grep per \s-1CPU\s0 and read bigfile one time per \s-1CPU,\s0
but as that is done in parallel, all reads except the first will be
cached in \s-1RAM.\s0 Depending on the size of regexp.txt it may be faster to
use \-\-block 10m instead of \-L1000. If regexp.txt is too big to fit in
\&\s-1RAM,\s0 remove \-\-round\-robin and adjust \-L1000. This will cause bigfile
to be read more times.
.PP
Some storage systems perform better when reading multiple chunks in
parallel. This is true for some \s-1RAID\s0 systems and for some network file
systems. To parallelize the reading of bigfile:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    parallel \-\-pipepart \-\-block 100M \-a bigfile \-k grep \-f regexp.txt
.Ve
.PP
This will split bigfile into 100MB chunks and run grep on each of
these chunks. To parallelize both reading of bigfile and regexp.txt
combine the two using \-\-fifo:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    parallel \-\-pipepart \-\-block 100M \-a bigfile \-\-fifo cat regexp.txt \e
\&    \e| parallel \-\-pipe \-L1000 \-\-round\-robin grep \-f \- {}

To process a big file or some output you can use \fB\-\-pipe\fR to split up
the data into blocks and pipe the blocks into the processing program.
.PP
If the program is \fBgzip \-9\fR you can do:
.PP
\&\fBcat bigfile | parallel \-\-pipe \-\-recend '' \-k gzip \-9 \fR>\fBbigfile.gz\fR

This will split \fBbigfile\fR into blocks of 1 \s-1MB\s0 and pass that to \fBgzip

\&\fBgzip \-9\fR will be kept in order and saved to \fBbigfile.gz\fR
.PP
\&\fBgzip\fR works fine if the output is appended, but some processing does
not work like that \- for example sorting. For this \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR can
put the output of each command into a file. This will sort a big file
in parallel:
.PP
\&\fBcat bigfile | parallel \-\-pipe \-\-files sort | parallel \-Xj1 sort \-m {} ';' rm {} \fR>\fBbigfile.sort\fR
.PP
Here \fBbigfile\fR is split into blocks of around 1MB, each block ending
in '\en' (which is the default for \fB\-\-recend\fR). Each block is passed
to \fBsort\fR and the output from \fBsort\fR is saved into files. These
files are passed to the second \fBparallel\fR that runs \fBsort \-m\fR on the

If you need to run a massive amount of jobs in parallel, then you will
likely hit the filehandle limit which is often around 250 jobs. If you
are super user you can raise the limit in /etc/security/limits.conf
but you can also use this workaround. The filehandle limit is per

.SH "EXAMPLE: GNU Parallel as queue system/batch manager"
.IX Header "EXAMPLE: GNU Parallel as queue system/batch manager"
\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR can work as a simple job queue system or batch manager.
The idea is to put the jobs into a file and have \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR read
from that continuously. As \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR will stop at end of file we
use \fBtail\fR to continue reading:
.PP
\&\fBtrue \fR>\fBjobqueue\fR; \fBtail \-n+0 \-f jobqueue | parallel\fR
.PP
To submit your jobs to the queue:
.PP
\&\fBecho my_command my_arg \fR>>\fB jobqueue\fR
.PP
You can of course use \fB\-S\fR to distribute the jobs to remote
computers:
.PP
\&\fBtrue \fR>\fBjobqueue\fR; \fBtail \-f jobqueue | parallel \-S ..\fR
.PP
There is a a small issue when using \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR as queue
system/batch manager: You have to submit JobSlot number of jobs before
they will start, and after that you can submit one at a time, and job
will start immediately if free slots are available.  Output from the
running or completed jobs are held back and will only be printed when
JobSlots more jobs has been started (unless you use \-\-ungroup or \-u,
in which case the output from the jobs are printed immediately).
E.g. if you have 10 jobslots then the output from the first completed
job will only be printed when job 11 has started, and the output of
second completed job will only be printed when job 12 has started.
.PP
To use \fB\-\-eof\fR to make \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR exit, \fBtail\fR also needs to be
forced to exit:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    tail \-n+0 \-f command\-list.txt |
\&      (parallel \-\-eof=EXIT {}; echo Parallel is now done;

.PP
If the files to be processed are in a tar file then unpacking one file
and processing it immediately may be faster than first unpacking all
files. Set up the dir processor as above and unpack into the dir.
.PP
Using \s-1GNU\s0 Parallel as dir processor has the same limitations as using
\&\s-1GNU\s0 Parallel as queue system/batch manager.
.SH "QUOTING"
.IX Header "QUOTING"
\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR is very liberal in quoting. You only need to quote
characters that have special meaning in shell:
.PP
( ) $ ` ' " < > ; | \e
.PP
and depending on context these needs to be quoted, too:
.PP
~ & # ! ? space * {
.PP
Therefore most people will never need more quoting than putting '\e'
in front of the special characters.
.PP
Often you can simply put \e' around every ':
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perl \-ne \*(Aq/^\eS+\es+\eS+$/ and print $ARGV,"\en"\*(Aq file
.Ve
.PP
can be quoted:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  parallel perl \-ne \e\*(Aq\*(Aq/^\eS+\es+\eS+$/ and print $ARGV,"\en"\*(Aq\e\*(Aq ::: file
.Ve
.PP
However, when you want to use a shell variable you need to quote the
$\-sign. Here is an example using \f(CW$PARALLEL_SEQ\fR. This variable is set
by \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR itself, so the evaluation of the $ must be done by
the sub shell started by \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR:
.PP
\&\fBseq 10 | parallel \-N2 echo seq:\e$PARALLEL_SEQ arg1:{1} arg2:{2}\fR
.PP
If the variable is set before \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR starts you can do this:
.PP
\&\fBVAR=this_is_set_before_starting\fR
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel echo {} \f(CB$VAR\fB\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest this_is_set_before_starting\fR
.PP
It is a little more tricky if the variable contains more than one space in a row:
.PP
\&\fBVAR=\*(L"two  spaces  between  each  word\*(R"\fR
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel echo {} \e'\*(L"$VAR\*(R"\e'\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest two  spaces  between  each  word\fR
.PP
If the variable should not be evaluated by the shell starting \s-1GNU
\&\s0\fBparallel\fR but be evaluated by the sub shell started by \s-1GNU
\&\s0\fBparallel\fR, then you need to quote it:
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel VAR=this_is_set_after_starting \e; echo {} \e$VAR\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest this_is_set_after_starting\fR
.PP
It is a little more tricky if the variable contains space:
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel VAR='\*(L"two  spaces  between  each  word\*(R"' echo {} \e'\*(L"$VAR\*(R"\e'\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest two  spaces  between  each  word\fR
.PP
$$ is the shell variable containing the process id of the shell. This
will print the process id of the shell running \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR:
.PP
\&\fBseq 10 | parallel echo $$\fR
.PP
And this will print the process ids of the sub shells started by \s-1GNU
\&\s0\fBparallel\fR.
.PP
\&\fBseq 10 | parallel echo \e$\e$\fR
.PP
If the special characters should not be evaluated by the sub shell
then you need to protect it against evaluation from both the shell
starting \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR and the sub shell:
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel echo {} \e\e\e$VAR\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest \f(CB$VAR\fB\fR
.PP
\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR can protect against evaluation by the sub shell by
using \-q:
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel \-q echo {} \e$VAR\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest \f(CB$VAR\fB\fR
.PP
This is particularly useful if you have lots of quoting. If you want to run a perl script like this:
.PP
\&\fBperl \-ne '/^\eS+\es+\eS+$/ and print \f(CB$ARGV\fB,\*(L"\en\*(R"' file\fR
.PP
It needs to be quoted like this:
.PP
\&\fBls | parallel perl \-ne '/^\e\eS+\e\es+\e\eS+\e$/\e and\e print\e \e$ARGV,\e\*(L"\e\en\e\*(R"'\fR
\&\fBls | parallel perl \-ne \e''/^\eS+\es+\eS+$/ and print \f(CB$ARGV\fB,\*(L"\en\*(R"'\e'\fR
.PP
Notice how spaces, \e's, "'s, and $'s need to be quoted. \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR
can do the quoting by using option \-q:
.PP
\&\fBls | parallel \-q  perl \-ne '/^\eS+\es+\eS+$/ and print \f(CB$ARGV\fB,\*(L"\en\*(R"'\fR
.PP
However, this means you cannot make the sub shell interpret special
characters. For example because of \fB\-q\fR this \s-1WILL NOT WORK:\s0
.PP
\&\fBls *.gz | parallel \-q "zcat {} \fR>\fB{.}"\fR
.PP
\&\fBls *.gz | parallel \-q "zcat {} | bzip2 \fR>\fB{.}.bz2"\fR
.PP
because > and | need to be interpreted by the sub shell.
.PP
If you get errors like:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  sh: \-c: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token
\&  sh: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string
\&  sh: \-c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching \`\*(Aq\*(Aq
\&  sh: \-c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file
.Ve
.PP
then you might try using \fB\-q\fR.
.PP
If you are using \fBbash\fR process substitution like \fB<(cat foo)\fR then
you may try \fB\-q\fR and prepending \fIcommand\fR with \fBbash \-c\fR:
.PP
\&\fBls | parallel \-q bash \-c 'wc \-c <(echo {})'\fR
.PP
Or for substituting output:
.PP
\&\fBls | parallel \-q bash \-c 'tar c {} | tee \fR>\fB(gzip \fR>\fB{}.tar.gz) | bzip2 \fR>\fB{}.tar.bz2'\fR
.PP
\&\fBConclusion\fR: To avoid dealing with the quoting problems it may be
easier just to write a small script or a function (remember to
\&\fBexport \-f\fR the function) and have \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR call that.

.SS "\s-1DIFFERENCES BETWEEN\s0 xargs \s-1AND GNU\s0 Parallel"
.IX Subsection "DIFFERENCES BETWEEN xargs AND GNU Parallel"
\&\fBxargs\fR offers some of the same possibilities as \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR.
.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR deals badly with special characters (such as space, ' and
"). To see the problem try this:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  touch important_file
\&  touch \*(Aqnot important_file\*(Aq
\&  ls not* | xargs rm
\&  mkdir \-p "My brother\*(Aqs 12\e" records"
\&  ls | xargs rmdir
.Ve
.PP
You can specify \fB\-0\fR or \fB\-d \*(L"\en\*(R"\fR, but many input generators are not
optimized for using \fB\s-1NUL\s0\fR as separator but are optimized for
\&\fBnewline\fR as separator. E.g \fBhead\fR, \fBtail\fR, \fBawk\fR, \fBls\fR, \fBecho\fR,
\&\fBsed\fR, \fBtar \-v\fR, \fBperl\fR (\fB\-0\fR and \e0 instead of \en), \fBlocate\fR
(requires using \fB\-0\fR), \fBfind\fR (requires using \fB\-print0\fR), \fBgrep\fR
(requires user to use \fB\-z\fR or \fB\-Z\fR), \fBsort\fR (requires using \fB\-z\fR).
.PP
So \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR's newline separation can be emulated with:
.PP
\&\fBcat | xargs \-d \*(L"\en\*(R" \-n1 \f(BIcommand\fB\fR
.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR can run a given number of jobs in parallel, but has no
support for running number-of-cpu-cores jobs in parallel.
.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR has no support for grouping the output, therefore output may
run together, e.g. the first half of a line is from one process and
the last half of the line is from another process. The example
\&\fBParallel grep\fR cannot be done reliably with \fBxargs\fR because of
this. To see this in action try:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  parallel perl \-e \*(Aq\e$a=\e"1{}\e"x10000000\e;print\e \e$a,\e"\e\en\e"\*(Aq \*(Aq>\*(Aq {} ::: a b c d e f
\&  ls \-l a b c d e f
\&  parallel \-kP4 \-n1 grep 1 > out.par ::: a b c d e f
\&  echo a b c d e f | xargs \-P4 \-n1 grep 1 > out.xargs\-unbuf
\&  echo a b c d e f | xargs \-P4 \-n1 grep \-\-line\-buffered 1 > out.xargs\-linebuf
\&  echo a b c d e f | xargs \-n1 grep 1 > out.xargs\-serial
\&  ls \-l out*
\&  md5sum out*
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR has no support for keeping the order of the output, therefore
if running jobs in parallel using \fBxargs\fR the output of the second
job cannot be postponed till the first job is done.
.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR has no support for running jobs on remote computers.
.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR has no support for context replace, so you will have to create the
arguments.
.PP
If you use a replace string in \fBxargs\fR (\fB\-I\fR) you can not force
\&\fBxargs\fR to use more than one argument.
.PP
Quoting in \fBxargs\fR works like \fB\-q\fR in \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR. This means
composed commands and redirection require using \fBbash \-c\fR.
.PP
\&\fBls | parallel "wc {} \fR> \fB{}.wc"\fR
.PP
becomes (assuming you have 8 cores)
.PP
\&\fBls | xargs \-d \*(L"\en\*(R" \-P8 \-I {} bash \-c "wc {} \fR>\fB {}.wc"\fR
.PP
and
.PP
\&\fBls | parallel \*(L"echo {}; ls {}|wc\*(R"\fR
.PP
becomes (assuming you have 8 cores)
.PP
\&\fBls | xargs \-d \*(L"\en\*(R" \-P8 \-I {} bash \-c \*(L"echo {}; ls {}|wc\*(R"\fR
.SS "\s-1DIFFERENCES BETWEEN\s0 find \-exec \s-1AND GNU\s0 Parallel"
.IX Subsection "DIFFERENCES BETWEEN find -exec AND GNU Parallel"
\&\fBfind \-exec\fR offer some of the same possibilities as \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR.
.PP
\&\fBfind \-exec\fR only works on files. So processing other input (such as
hosts or URLs) will require creating these inputs as files. \fBfind
\&\-exec\fR has no support for running commands in parallel.
.SS "\s-1DIFFERENCES BETWEEN\s0 make \-j \s-1AND GNU\s0 Parallel"
.IX Subsection "DIFFERENCES BETWEEN make -j AND GNU Parallel"
\&\fBmake \-j\fR can run jobs in parallel, but requires a crafted Makefile
to do this. That results in extra quoting to get filename containing
newline to work correctly.
.PP
\&\fBmake \-j\fR has no support for grouping the output, therefore output
may run together, e.g. the first half of a line is from one process
and the last half of the line is from another process. The example
\&\fBParallel grep\fR cannot be done reliably with \fBmake \-j\fR because of
this.
.PP
(Very early versions of \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR were coincidently implemented
using \fBmake \-j\fR).
.SS "\s-1DIFFERENCES BETWEEN\s0 ppss \s-1AND GNU\s0 Parallel"
.IX Subsection "DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ppss AND GNU Parallel"
\&\fBppss\fR is also a tool for running jobs in parallel.
.PP
The output of \fBppss\fR is status information and thus not useful for
using as input for another command. The output from the jobs are put
into files.
.PP
The argument replace string ($ITEM) cannot be changed. Arguments must
be quoted \- thus arguments containing special characters (space '"&!*)
may cause problems. More than one argument is not supported. File
names containing newlines are not processed correctly. When reading
input from a file null cannot be used as a terminator. \fBppss\fR needs
to read the whole input file before starting any jobs.
.PP
Output and status information is stored in ppss_dir and thus requires
cleanup when completed. If the dir is not removed before running
\&\fBppss\fR again it may cause nothing to happen as \fBppss\fR thinks the
task is already done. \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR will normally not need cleaning
up if running locally and will only need cleaning up if stopped
abnormally and running remote (\fB\-\-cleanup\fR may not complete if
stopped abnormally). The example \fBParallel grep\fR would require extra
postprocessing if written using \fBppss\fR.
.PP
For remote systems \s-1PPSS\s0 requires 3 steps: config, deploy, and
start. \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR only requires one step.
.PP

.IX Subsection "DIFFERENCES BETWEEN prll AND GNU Parallel"
\&\fBprll\fR is also a tool for running jobs in parallel. It does not
support running jobs on remote computers.
.PP
\&\fBprll\fR encourages using \s-1BASH\s0 aliases and \s-1BASH\s0 functions instead of

fine.

.SS "\s-1DIFFERENCES BETWEEN\s0 map \s-1AND GNU\s0 Parallel"
.IX Subsection "DIFFERENCES BETWEEN map AND GNU Parallel"
\&\fBmap\fR sees it as a feature to have less features and in doing so it
also handles corner cases incorrectly. A lot of \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR's code
is to handle corner cases correctly on every platform, so you will not
get a nasty surprise if a user for example saves a file called: \fIMy
brother's 12" records.txt\fR
.PP
\&\fBmap\fR's example showing how to deal with special characters fails on
special characters:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  echo "The Cure" > My\e brother\e\*(Aqs\e 12\e"\e records
\&
\&  ls | map \*(Aqecho \-n \`gzip < "%" | wc \-c\`; echo \-n \*(Aq*100/\*(Aq; wc \-c < "%"\*(Aq | bc
.Ve
.PP
It works with \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ls | parallel \*(Aqecho \-n \`gzip < {} | wc \-c\`; echo \-n \*(Aq*100/\*(Aq; wc \-c < {}\*(Aq | bc
.Ve
.PP
And you can even get the file name prepended:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ls | parallel \-\-tag \*(Aq(echo \-n \`gzip < {} | wc \-c\`\*(Aq*100/\*(Aq; wc \-c < {}) | bc\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBmap\fR has no support for grouping. So this gives the wrong results
without any warnings:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  parallel perl \-e \*(Aq\e$a=\e"1{}\e"x10000000\e;print\e \e$a,\e"\e\en\e"\*(Aq \*(Aq>\*(Aq {} ::: a b c d e f

\&  map \-p 1 \*(Aqgrep \-\-line\-buffered 1\*(Aq a b c d e f > out.map\-serial
\&  ls \-l out*
\&  md5sum out*
.Ve
.PP
The documentation shows a workaround, but not only does that mix
stdout (standard output) with stderr (standard error) it also fails
completely for certain jobs (and may even be considered less readable):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  parallel echo \-n {} ::: 1 2 3
\&
\&  map \-p 4 \*(Aqecho \-n % 2>&1 | sed \-e "s/^/$$:/"\*(Aq 1 2 3 | sort | cut \-f2\- \-d:
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBmap\fR cannot handle bundled options: \fBmap \-vp 0 echo this fails\fR
.PP
\&\fBmap\fR does not have an argument separator on the command line, but
uses the first argument as command. This makes quoting harder which again
may affect readability. Compare:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  map \-p 2 perl\e\e\e \-ne\e\e\e \e\e\e\*(Aq/^\e\e\e\eS+\e\e\e\es+\e\e\e\eS+\e\e\e$/\e\e\e and\e\e\e print\e\e\e \e\e\e$ARGV,\e\e\e"\e\e\e\en\e\e\e"\e\e\e\*(Aq *
\&
\&  parallel \-q perl \-ne \*(Aq/^\eS+\es+\eS+$/ and print $ARGV,"\en"\*(Aq ::: *
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBmap\fR can do multiple arguments with context replace, but not without
context replace:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  parallel \-\-xargs echo \*(AqBEGIN{\*(Aq{}\*(Aq}END\*(Aq ::: 1 2 3
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBmap\fR does not set exit value according to whether one of the jobs
failed:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  parallel false ::: 1 || echo Job failed
\&
\&  map false 1 || echo Never run
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBmap\fR requires Perl v5.10.0 making it harder to use on old systems.
.PP
\&\fBmap\fR has no way of using % in the command (\s-1GNU\s0 Parallel has \-I to
specify another replacement string than {}).
.PP
By design \fBmap\fR is option incompatible with \fBxargs\fR, it does not
have remote job execution, a structured way of saving results,
multiple input sources, progress indicator, configurable record
delimiter (only field delimiter), logging of jobs run with possibility
to resume, keeping the output in the same order as input, \-\-pipe
processing, and dynamically timeouts.
.SS "\s-1DIFFERENCES BETWEEN\s0 ladon \s-1AND GNU\s0 Parallel"

\&\fBladon\fR can run multiple jobs on files in parallel.
.PP
\&\fBladon\fR only works on files and the only way to specify files is
using a quoted glob string (such as \e*.jpg). It is not possible to
list the files manually.
.PP
As replacement strings it uses \s-1FULLPATH DIRNAME BASENAME EXT RELDIR RELPATH\s0
.PP
These can be simulated using \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR by putting this in \fB~/.parallel/config\fR:
.PP
.Vb 6

.PP
\&\fBladon\fR deals badly with filenames containing " and newline, and it fails for output larger than 200k:

.SS "\s-1DIFFERENCES BETWEEN\s0 ClusterSSH \s-1AND GNU\s0 Parallel"
.IX Subsection "DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ClusterSSH AND GNU Parallel"
ClusterSSH solves a different problem than \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR.
.PP
ClusterSSH opens a terminal window for each computer and using a
master window you can run the same command on all the computers. This
is typically used for administrating several computers that are almost
identical.
.PP
\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR runs the same (or different) commands with different
arguments in parallel possibly using remote computers to help
computing. If more than one computer is listed in \fB\-S\fR \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR may
only use one of these (e.g. if there are 8 jobs to be run and one
computer has 8 cores).
.PP
\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR can be used as a poor-man's version of ClusterSSH:
.PP

.PP
\&\s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR is slow at starting up \- around 250 ms the first time
and 150 ms after that.
.PP
\fIJob startup\fR
.IX Subsection "Job startup"
.PP
Starting a job on the local machine takes around 10 ms. This can be a
big overhead if the job takes very few ms to run. Often you can group
small jobs together using \fB\-X\fR which will make the overhead less
significant. Or you can run multiple \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fRs as described in
\&\fB\s-1EXAMPLE:\s0 Speeding up fast jobs\fR.
.PP
\fI\s-1SSH\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "SSH"
.PP
When using multiple computers \s-1GNU \s0\fBparallel\fR opens \fBssh\fR connections
to them to figure out how many connections can be used reliably
simultaneously (Namely \s-1SSHD\s0's MaxStartups). This test is done for each
host in serial, so if your \fB\-\-sshloginfile\fR contains many hosts it may
be slow.
.PP
If your jobs are short you may see that there are fewer jobs running
on the remove systems than expected. This is due to time spent logging
in and out. \fB\-M\fR may help here.
.PP
\fIDisk access\fR
.IX Subsection "Disk access"
.PP
A single disk can normally read data faster if it reads one file at a
time instead of reading a lot of files in parallel, as this will avoid
disk seeks. However, newer disk systems with multiple drives can read
faster if reading from multiple files in parallel.
.PP
If the jobs are of the form read-all-compute-all-write-all, so
everything is read before anything is written, it may be faster to
force only one disk access at the time:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sem \-\-id diskio cat file | compute | sem \-\-id diskio cat > file
.Ve
.PP
If the jobs are of the form read-compute-write, so writing starts
before all reading is done, it may be faster to force only one reader
and writer at the time:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sem \-\-id read cat file | compute | sem \-\-id write cat > file
.Ve
.PP
If the jobs are of the form read-compute-read-compute, it may be
faster to run more jobs in parallel than the system has CPUs, as some
of the jobs will be stuck waiting for disk access.
.SS "\-\-nice limits command length"
.IX Subsection "--nice limits command length"
The current implementation of \fB\-\-nice\fR is too pessimistic in the max
allowed command length. It only uses a little more than half of what
it could. This affects \fB\-X\fR and \fB\-m\fR. If this becomes a real problem for
you file a bug-report.
.SS "Aliases and functions do not work"
.IX Subsection "Aliases and functions do not work"

.PP
\&\fBCan't exec "\f(BIcommand\fB": No such file or directory\fR
.PP
or:
.PP
\&\fBopen3: exec of by \f(BIcommand\fB failed\fR
.PP
it may be because \fIcommand\fR is not known, but it could also be
because \fIcommand\fR is an alias or a function. If it is a function you
need to \fBexport \-f\fR the function first. An alias will, however, not
work (see why http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=484296), so
change your alias to a script.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
.IX Header "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug\-parallel@gnu.org> or

.PP
Your bug report should always include:
.IP "\(bu" 2
The error message you get (if any).
.IP "\(bu" 2
The complete output of \fBparallel \-\-version\fR. If you are not running
the latest released version you should specify why you believe the
problem is not fixed in that version.
.IP "\(bu" 2
A complete example that others can run that shows the problem. This
should preferably be small and simple. A combination of \fByes\fR,
\&\fBseq\fR, \fBcat\fR, \fBecho\fR, and \fBsleep\fR can reproduce most errors. If
your example requires large files, see if you can make them by
something like \fBseq 1000000\fR > \fBfile\fR or \fByes | head \-n 10000000\fR >
\&\fBfile\fR. If your example requires remote execution, see if you can
use \fBlocalhost\fR \- maybe using another login.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The output of your example. If your problem is not easily reproduced
by others, the output might help them figure out the problem.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Whether you have watched the intro videos
(http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL284C9FF2488BC6D1), walked
through the tutorial (man parallel_tutorial), and read the \s-1EXAMPLE\s0
section in the man page (man parallel \- search for \s-1EXAMPLE:\s0).
.PP
If you suspect the error is dependent on your environment or
distribution, please see if you can reproduce the error on one of
these VirtualBox images:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualboximage/files/
.PP
Specifying the name of your distribution is not enough as you may have
installed software that is not in the VirtualBox images.
.PP
If you cannot reproduce the error on any of the VirtualBox images
above, you should assume the debugging will be done through you. That
will put more burden on you and it is extra important you give any
information that help. In general the problem will be fixed faster and
with less work for you if you can reproduce the error on a VirtualBox.
